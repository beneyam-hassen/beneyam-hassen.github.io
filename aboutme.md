### My story

I'm an Ethiopian-American at Williams College, studying Sociology and Studio Art. I love taking photos, spending time with my best friends, and going on mini adventures. A goal I've had recently is to reduce my phone use, it is currently going well. 

### My CSCI story

In a world where computers and AI are becoming central to our society, I want to have the most basic knowledge of Computer Science. I'm a humanities-focused student, so taking CSCI 104 is a step for me to venture out of my comfort zone. Looking at the syllabus, I'm very excited to sew and create, as Marx says, the purpose of humans is to create; create beautiful things.
