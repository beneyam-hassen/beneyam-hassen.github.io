Beneyam's Computer Screen Distance Shirt

I spend hours editing photos, sitting behind a screen. After a bit I can feel my eyes straining, and I find myself getting closer and closer to my screen. Originally, I was going to make glasses that would detect and alert me when I am too close to my screen using a light sensor, but the objects were too large and it became unfeasible. I decide to keep the same plan but onto a shirt instead, the buzzer will go off if I get too close, and the status of the LED will change from green to red. 

Materials needed:
- 1 LilyPad Arduino
- 1 LilyPad Light Sensor
- 1 LilyPad Buzzer
- 1 Button
- 2 RGB LEDs
- Conductive Thread
- Shirt
- Thread

The following was my first paper prototype

The following is my revised paper prototype

The following is my working alligator clips (chomp chomp)

3 tips to myself:
1. I wished re-did my paper prototype after I decided to alter somethings because some of the smaller things that I had thought through, such as orientation of the items to reduce overlapping, were nullified. 


2. Had I given myself more time during the paper prototype stage, I might have been able to think through more alternatives besides a shirt to the eye mask I originally started with.

   
3. I was glad to have worked on this on two screens, because that meant that I could have my previous assignments, which this one is very similar to, as refrences for the coding.
