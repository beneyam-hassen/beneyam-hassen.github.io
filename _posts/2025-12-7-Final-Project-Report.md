Beneyam's Computer Screen Distance Shirt
I spend hours editing photos, sitting behind a screen. After a bit I can feel my eyes straining, and I find myself getting closer and closer to my screen. Originally, I was going to make glasses that would detect and alert me when I am too close to my screen using a light sensor, but the objects were too large and it became unfeasible. I decide to keep the same plan but onto a shirt instead, the buzzer will go off if I get too close, and the status of the LED will change from green to red. 

Materials needed:
- 1 LilyPad Arduino
- 1 LilyPad Light Sensor
- 1 LilyPad Buzzer
- 1 Button
- 2 RGB LEDs
- Conductive Thread
- Shirt
- Thread
